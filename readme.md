### Nim language plugin for NeoVim

Minimal fork without nimsuggest (highlight, go-to-def and autocomplete).

This would be good together with treesitter to avoid multiple nimsuggest
instances, but alaviss/nim.nvim is still compensating for lacking highlighting
from treesitter, so use alaviss' instead (together with treesitter).
